### Forking a repo, adding a file, committing, and sending a pull request 
- (1) fork our repo on github
- (2) clone _your fork_ to your machine
- (3) copy the rbm_equations.iypnb template: `cp rbm_equations.ipynb <your_name>.rbm_equations.ipynb`
- (4) work through the template
  - if you're writing latex, remember to change the cell type to 'markdown'
- (5) add, and commit 1 or more times while you are working:
  - `git add <your_name>.rbm_equations.ipynb`
  - `git commit -m 'your message'`
  - `git push`

(6) at the end of the session, submit a pull request to the main repo with the work that you did
